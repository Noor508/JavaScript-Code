        Synchoronus in Javascript
    </h1>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Every instruction wait for previous to complete it's executions.
            </li>
            <li>
                instructions run in a sequence.
            </li>
            <li>
                Instructions performs one after one in a sequence.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>
        Drawbacks
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Sometimes few instructions take more time to execute so that next instruction has to wait for previous to complete it's execution. It becomes blocker for next and wait time increase
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Real-World Example of Synchronous Processing</h2>
    <p>Imagine you are going to register for your ID card at a government office for the first time. When you arrive, you take a token and then wait for your turn. The office follows a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) system, meaning that each person is served in the order they arrived. You cannot proceed with your registration until it's your turn, and the next person must wait until you have completed your process. This is similar to synchronous programming, where each task must wait for the previous one to finish before starting. 
        <h3>Drawbacks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Long time waits if there is only one counter for customer dealing
            </li>
            <li>
                if someone has any document missing , and he/she took more time than standard time then you have to wait for resolving that blocakge.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
